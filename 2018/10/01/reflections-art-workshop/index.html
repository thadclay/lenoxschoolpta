For those of you who are unaware, the Reflections Program is a national PTA cornerstone arts program that was developed in 1969 by the then Colorado State PTA President Mary Lou Anderson. The program’s purpose is to encourage students to explore their talents and express themselves.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Each year, students in grades preschool through 12 bring the Reflections theme to life through dance choreography, film production, literature, music composition, photography and visual arts. Students submit their artwork to Local PTAs for initial judging. In New York, entries have the opportunity to advance from the local level to the region, state and national levels. Students can submit more than one entry in one category or in different categories. This year&#39;s theme is &quot;Heroes Around Me” Respond to the theme Heroes Around Me through dance, a short film, a poem or story, an original song, a photo or visual work of art. All forms and projects are due by November 2, 2018. We encourage all students who wish to do so to participate. Students may seek the assistance of adults (i.e. parents, the music teacher or the art teacher). But all entries submitted must be the original work of the student submitting an entry. Lenox will host an open art studio with materials and assistance Thursdays from 3-5 pm October 11,18, 25 and November 1st for students that want to work on their projects.</p>
<p>Attached to this letter, you will find the National PTA Reflections Program General Participation Rules. If you need more detailed information, you can visit the New York State PTA website at <a href="https://nyspta.org/home/programs/reflections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nyspta.org/home/programs/reflections/</a> . All students who submit work for judging will be recognized at a district-wide awards ceremony and their work will be on display for members of the community to view this winter. The deadline for students to submit their entry for initial judging is Friday, November 2, 2018.</p>
<p>Good Luck!<br>Sincerely,<br>Iechia Drinkwater-Louverture</p>
